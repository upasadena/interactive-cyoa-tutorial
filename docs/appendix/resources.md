        Hello friends, I am the guy who owns the Dropbox linked up top. I added
        a notepad to the dropbox. If you are a CYOA author and wish to see your 
        CYOA in the dropbox, the most expedient way would be emailing my new
        Yahoo! account "Dropboxanon@yahoo.com' with the CYOA. Adding a name
        either in the subject or body attached to the email would be helpful.
