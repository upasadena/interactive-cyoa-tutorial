* [AvifCyoaCompressor]^([repo][avif-repo])^ ^([post][avif-post])^ – By
  blathers16/bubo_virginianus. A tool that compresses CYOAs massively by
  converting the images to the .avif or webm format, which supports both
  regular images and GIFs, dropping the project size anywhere from 30 to 55%.

!!! warning

    Some people find that this website's quality slider doesn't work, and may
    end up increasing the file size. Please make sure to backup any work before
    using this tool, and compare the `project.json`s' file sizes before
    deciding to upload it[^Aquagirl2001].

  that checks CYOAs too make sure that there are no bugs.

  jsons in various ways.

    Some example tasks that it can do on ICC jsons (go to the repo link to get
    detailed info):

    * Refreshing Discord links, downloading images to a image folder and updating urls accordingly.
    * Converting Images (image format, image quality can be chosen) when saving
      after downloading.

    * Converting Base64 embedded images to local images in image folder and
