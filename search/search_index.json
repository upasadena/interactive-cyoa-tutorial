Now nesting rows in and of itself isn't a bad thing. It prevents having to scroll through hundreds of choices to find the section you want (one of the few design flaws of the WoW ICYOA listed above). Instead, you design the  various rows to only show when the prerequisite choice is active, basically showing up at the push of a button. Nesting rows occurs when the button for a row is inside another row, which can be inside another row, and so on.  Overusing this can lead to your users being confused and annoyed, having to search through nested row after nested row to find the section they want. Not fun. Finding the right balance between \"ALL THE CHOICES\" and \"Where the hell is it!\" is important.</p> <p>Another problem with nested rows is avoiding orphaned rows. Orphaned rows  occur when attempting to close multiple levels of nested rows by closing the top row leaves the lower rows still visible. This is an annoying design flaw that forces your users to close nested rows in order, every time.</p> <p>What's worse is if the button for a nested row is a choice you want to keep, leaving you unable to close the orphan row without screwing up your  build. This is both aggravating and very unprofessional. To counteract this, require all your nested rows to need all previous levels active to  appear. Thus, if you close an upper level, it will close all lower levels. This does become slightly tedious to code the deeper a nested row is, however.<sup>1</sup></p>"},{"location":"appendix/reference/#ex-todo-combining-multiple-requirements","title":"(EX TODO) Combining Multiple Requirements","text":"<p>Chaining multiple requirements onto one object means that you require all of those requirements in order to allow the object to be chosen or shown.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You can use multiple requirements and scoring to make discounts on options.</p> <p>An example of this logic in pseudocode would be:</p> <ul> <li>\"If this choice that gives a discount is selected, then it costs 5     points\"</li> <li>\"If this choice that gives a discount is not selected, then it costs     10 points\"</li> </ul> <p>You can learn more about making discounts here.</p> Example <p>\u2026</p>"},{"location":"appendix/reference/#wip-nesting-multiple-requirements","title":"(WIP) Nesting Multiple Requirements","text":"<p>Nesting multiple requirements means to apply requirements onto requirements themselves.

This is because once private styling is turned on, the styling cannot be overridden by the global options.</p> <p>So if, for example, you decide you like a different font in CYOA, but you have a dozen private stylized sections, you would need to either:</p> <ol> <li>Go to each of those sections for each change you make, and change the    private styling, or</li> <li>Turn off private styling to reset the styling, then reapplying the private    style options for each section.</li> </ol> <p>Both of which are very time consuming. It is important to design top-down, so to speak.</p>"},{"location":"styling/design/#stardustanons-advice","title":"StarDustAnon's Advice","text":"<p>Below is a snippet from Some Musings by a CYOA Author by StarDustAnon, a text focused on advice for creating static CYOAs. Although for static CYOAs, I believe this advice applies no matter the format a CYOA is presented from.</p> <p>I know what I said before: graphics isn't entirely necessary. But design isn't the same as graphics. Design encompasses your CYOA no matter what. Design is how your readers see your CYOA.</p> <p>You can't go wrong with a simple text document. The text is easily readable, you can add images here and there depending on what program you use, you can change fonts and styles a little. But for the most part, a text document is purely about presenting the guts of your product: the writing.</p> <p>Believe it or not, text has design to it, even if you simply go with default fonts and no pictures for your CYOA. I should clarify: you can't go wrong with a simple text document -while- utilizing default fonts. Default fonts (TNR, Arial, Helvetica, etc) are all fonts made to be legible at the default font size (usually 12). </p> <p>So then you decide to step into the world of more vibrant design choices. Maybe you've seen a nice looking font you want to use and you decide to use it. Consider this carefully: how hard is it to read your text now? Does it make you squint your eyes? Does it strain them? Hell, does it even make your eyesight stutter a little bit, no matter how minuscule? If yes, then you've made a bad design choice. No, this doesn't mean to back-track immediately before the world ends. If it's a minuscule problem, it's a minuscule bad design choice. Just be mindful that it will affect your reader's experience.</p> <p>For body text, you always want to stick with clean, easy-to-read fonts. If you have a portion of text that's more than five words, it's probably better to have it as an easy-to-read font. However, if you have a simple title or name, feel free to stylize it. This is what stylish text is for: eyecandy, and it's best reflected in the titles that represent your CYOA, right? Besides, you usually want to have your titles a larger font size than your body text, so titles can accommodate more complex graphics.</p> <p>The second most important thing when considering design is your colour choices. Again, you can't go wrong with the default: black text on white background. It's the perfect contrast whose singular goal is legibility. White text on grey background is even better, as it promotes less eye strain.</p> <p>The two main things you have to consider when choosing your colours is contrast and eye strain, which go hand-in-hand. Is your text contrasted enough with its background to be easy to read? Is it too contrasted to make it hard to read? Are the colours too saturated? One of the things I hate the most in bad design is oversaturation. I spend a lot of time just picking the colours to use, and you'll notice in a lot of my works that the colours I like to roll with are rather modest. Even in something vibrant like Battlemage, I choose blues, reds, and greens that have a healthy mix of greyish shades mixed in. Saturation is for things you want to emphasize or highlight. A border around a title? Make it glow to show its brilliance.</p> <p>To summarize:</p> <ol> <li>Text that is clean and easy-to-read is good design</li> <li>Text that is hard to read and straining is bad design</li> <li>Colours with too much contrast and saturation are bad design</li> </ol>"},{"location":"styling/design/#contrast","title":"Contrast","text":"<p>contrast noun</p> <p>differences in colour, tone, or shape that contribute to the visual effect of a design or image.</p> <p>Contrast is good. With a low amount of contrast we would not be able to tell where one thing ends and another begins. But like with all things, too much of it is just as bad a thing. High contrast can make your text straining to read, which is not what we want as ICYOA creators.</p> <p>So how do you tell if your colour palette has too much contrast? Well there are tools to help with that. Consider Contrast Checker. It is tool where you can compare foreground and background colours to see if it has good contrast or not<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Here's an example:</p> Good ContrastBad Contrast <p></p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, this tool can tell us whether our colour palette has too much of a high contrast, and it can tell us where it starts becoming easy on the eyes.</p> <p>WebAIM also has more resources, like:</p> <ul> <li>Link Contrast Checker, much the same as the Contrast Checker from earlier, but takes links into account.</li> <li>WAVE, a tool to check the accessibility of an entire page.</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>Credit to <code>spartango</code> on Discord for making me aware of this website\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"}]}
