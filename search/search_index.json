The     first line and blank lines are not indented by default.</p> int function (value, default, base) <p>Convert the value into an integer. If the     conversion doesn't work it will return <code>0</code>. You can     override this default using the first parameter. You     can also override the default base (10) in the second     parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as     0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively.     The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values.</p> join function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the     sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per     default, you can define it with the optional parameter.</p> last function (environment, seq) <p>Return the last item of a sequence.</p> length builtin_function_or_method <p>Return the number of items in a container.</p> list function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Convert the value into a list.  If it was a string the returned list     will be a list of characters.</p> lower function (s) <p>Convert a value to lowercase.</p> items function (value) <p>Return an iterator over the <code>(key, value)</code> items of a mapping.</p> map function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute.     This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really     only interested in a certain value of it.</p> min function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the smallest item from the sequence.</p> max function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the largest item from the sequence.</p> pprint function (value) <p>Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging.</p> random function (context, seq) <p>Return a random item from the sequence.</p> reject function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> rejectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test     succeeding.</p> replace function (eval_ctx, s, old, new, count) <p>Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring     replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring     that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string.     If the optional third argument <code>count</code> is given, only the first     <code>count</code> occurrences are replaced.</p> reverse function (value, rv, e) <p>Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other     way round.</p> round function (value, precision, method, func) <p>Round the number to a given precision. The first     parameter specifies the precision (default is <code>0</code>), the     second the rounding method.</p> safe function (value) <p>Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic     escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped.</p> select function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> selectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the     test succeeding.</p> slice function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing     those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing     three ul tags that represent columns.</p> sort function (environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func) <p>Sort an iterable using Python's :func:<code>sorted</code>.</p> string builtin_function_or_method <p>Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves a :class:<code>Markup</code> string rather than converting it back to a basic string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped again.</p> striptags function (value) <p>Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space.</p> sum function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter     'start' (which defaults to 0).  When the sequence is empty it returns     start.</p> title function (s) <p>Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with     uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase.</p> trim function (value, chars) <p>Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace.</p> truncate function (env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result) <p>Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified     with the first parameter which defaults to <code>255</code>. If the second     parameter is <code>true</code> the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise     it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact     truncated it will append an ellipsis sign (<code>\"...\"</code>). If you want a     different ellipsis sign than <code>\"...\"</code> you can specify it using the     third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance     margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated.</p> unique function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key) <p>Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable.</p> upper function (s) <p>Convert a value to uppercase.</p> urlencode function (value, items) <p>Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8.</p> urlize function (eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv) <p>Convert URLs in text into clickable links.</p> wordcount function (s) <p>Count the words in that string.</p> wordwrap function (environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens) <p>Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated     as paragraphs to be wrapped separately.</p> xmlattr function (eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv) <p>Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict.     All values that are neither <code>none</code> nor <code>undefined</code> are automatically     escaped.</p> tojson function (eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumps, kwargs) <p>Serialize an object to a string of JSON, and mark it safe to     render in HTML. This filter is only for use in HTML documents.</p>"},{"location":"static/reddit_post/","title":"Complete Interactive CYOA Tutorial","text":"<p>Link: https://icctutorial.pages.dev</p> <p>This is a tutorial and guide for the Interactive CYOA Creator by MeanDelay.

This is because once private styling is turned on, the styling cannot be overridden by the global options.</p> <p>So if, for example, you decide you like a different font in CYOA, but you have a dozen private stylized sections, you would need to either:</p> <ol> <li>Go to each of those sections for each change you make, and change the    private styling, or</li> <li>Turn off private styling to reset the styling, then reapplying the private    style options for each section.</li> </ol> <p>Both of which are very time consuming. It is important to design top-down, so to speak.</p>"},{"location":"styling/design/#stardustanons-advice","title":"StarDustAnon's Advice","text":"<p>Below is a snippet from Some Musings by a CYOA Author by StarDustAnon, a text focused on advice for creating static CYOAs. Although for static CYOAs, I believe this advice applies no matter the format a CYOA is presented from.</p> <p>I know what I said before: graphics isn't entirely necessary. But design isn't the same as graphics. Design encompasses your CYOA no matter what. Design is how your readers see your CYOA.</p> <p>You can't go wrong with a simple text document. The text is easily readable, you can add images here and there depending on what program you use, you can change fonts and styles a little. But for the most part, a text document is purely about presenting the guts of your product: the writing.</p> <p>Believe it or not, text has design to it, even if you simply go with default fonts and no pictures for your CYOA. I should clarify: you can't go wrong with a simple text document -while- utilizing default fonts. Default fonts (TNR, Arial, Helvetica, etc) are all fonts made to be legible at the default font size (usually 12). </p> <p>So then you decide to step into the world of more vibrant design choices. Maybe you've seen a nice looking font you want to use and you decide to use it. Consider this carefully: how hard is it to read your text now? Does it make you squint your eyes? Does it strain them? Hell, does it even make your eyesight stutter a little bit, no matter how minuscule? If yes, then you've made a bad design choice. No, this doesn't mean to back-track immediately before the world ends. If it's a minuscule problem, it's a minuscule bad design choice. Just be mindful that it will affect your reader's experience.</p> <p>For body text, you always want to stick with clean, easy-to-read fonts. If you have a portion of text that's more than five words, it's probably better to have it as an easy-to-read font. However, if you have a simple title or name, feel free to stylize it. This is what stylish text is for: eyecandy, and it's best reflected in the titles that represent your CYOA, right? Besides, you usually want to have your titles a larger font size than your body text, so titles can accommodate more complex graphics.</p> <p>The second most important thing when considering design is your colour choices. Again, you can't go wrong with the default: black text on white background. It's the perfect contrast whose singular goal is legibility. White text on grey background is even better, as it promotes less eye strain.</p> <p>The two main things you have to consider when choosing your colours is contrast and eye strain, which go hand-in-hand. Is your text contrasted enough with its background to be easy to read? Is it too contrasted to make it hard to read? Are the colours too saturated? One of the things I hate the most in bad design is oversaturation. I spend a lot of time just picking the colours to use, and you'll notice in a lot of my works that the colours I like to roll with are rather modest. Even in something vibrant like Battlemage, I choose blues, reds, and greens that have a healthy mix of greyish shades mixed in. Saturation is for things you want to emphasize or highlight. A border around a title? Make it glow to show its brilliance.</p> <p>To summarize:</p> <ol> <li>Text that is clean and easy-to-read is good design</li> <li>Text that is hard to read and straining is bad design</li> <li>Colours with too much contrast and saturation are bad design</li> </ol>"},{"location":"styling/design/#contrast","title":"Contrast","text":"<p>contrast noun</p> <p>differences in colour, tone, or shape that contribute to the visual effect of a design or image.</p> <p>Contrast is good. With a low amount of contrast we would not be able to tell where one thing ends and another begins. But like with all things, too much of it is just as bad a thing. High contrast can make your text straining to read, which is not what we want as ICYOA creators.</p> <p>So how do you tell if your colour palette has too much contrast? Well there are tools to help with that. Consider Contrast Checker. It is tool where you can compare foreground and background colours to see if it has good contrast or not<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>People often perceive the blue part of the visible spectrum a little worse, so blue on a black background can be poorly read, despite sufficient contrast.[^2]</p> <p>Here's an example of good and bad contrast:</p> Good ContrastBad Contrast <p></p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, this tool can tell us whether our colour palette has too much of a high contrast, and it can tell us where it starts becoming easy on the eyes.</p> <p>There are other resources for this, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Colour Contrast Checker \u2013 A website that   performs much the same function.
